# lzysnippets README

Javascript snippets for lazy coders

## Features
$ll
Write an ES6 let function by typing $ll.  The cursor will be initially located inside a comment previous to the function.  Once you've written appropriate comment, tabbing will take you through: the space for the variable name, arguments, the return statement, and finally leave you after the function.

$lc
Write an ES6 const function with same functionality as above in the return statement by typing $lc
This is used in the same way as $ll above

Console.log with $cl
Console.log a string with $cls
Console.trace with $ct
Console.trace a string with $cts
