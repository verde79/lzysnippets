# lzysnippets README

snippets for lazy coders

## html snippets
$sty - add link to stylesheet
$hol - add a link that opens in a new tab (but uses noopener to avoid reverse tabnabbing)

## javascript snippets
$ll
Write an ES6 let function by typing $ll.  The cursor will be initially located inside a comment previous to the function.  Once you've written appropriate comment, tabbing will take you through: the space for the variable name, arguments, the return statement, and finally leave you after the function.

$lc
Write an ES6 const function with same functionality as above in the return statement by typing $lc
This is used in the same way as $ll above

$cl - Console.log
$cls - Console.log a string
$ct - Console.trace
$cts - Console.trace a string
